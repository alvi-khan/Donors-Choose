# Donors Choose

This program will accumulate information provided by different charity organizations. This will make it convenient for users to find specific services provided by charities that would otherwise be difficult to locate, and make existing mediums of donations, like monetary donations through the official websites of the charities, swift and easy to use. It will also make it more convenient for the charity organizations to manage their services and bring attention to themselves.

## Usage

The application itself should be fairly intuitive to use. Users will be able to register for accounts through the application. However, the development team has decided to not allow charity organizations to register for accounts through the application to prevent abuse. Charity organization's are requested to contact the developers for further information.
